I am currently a last year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Information at [Hefei University of Technology](http://en.hfut.edu.cn/). I am working at the LMC Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Meng Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/meng-wang/home). Before being a Ph.D. Candidate, I received my B.S. degree in E.E. at Hefei University of Technology in 2015. My research interests lie in the general area of data mining and machine learning, particularly in large-scale machine learning, interpretable and robust deep learning.
