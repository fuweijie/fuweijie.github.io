I am currently a last-year Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science and Information at Hefei University of Technology. I am working at the Lab of Multimedia Computing (LMC)  under the supervision of Prof. [Meng Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/meng-wang/home). Before being a Ph.D. Candidate, I received my B.S. degree in E.E. at Hefei University of Technology in 2015.
